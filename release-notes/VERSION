New minor version, with following changes:

  compatibility). @JacksonXmlElementWrapper allows explicit per-property

  id value for serialization of a reference property.
* [Issue#33]: Ignore attributes of elements for "List" objects
* [Issue#36]: Add 'JacksonXmlModule.setXMLTextElementName()' to allow
  matching 'value' text property of JAXB beans.

* [Issue-29]: Binary value not cleared, leading to duplicated binary data
  for POJOs.
